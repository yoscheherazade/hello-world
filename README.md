# hello-world
I'm just a bill.
Yesterday in class I finally (kind of) learned how to loop in Python.
I can't believe how easy it was.
I even made a simple guessing game with it that I was way too proud of.
Years from now, I want to look back on this with equal amounts of shame
and pride at how I actually almost cried after spending 12 hours trying 
to write ONE LOOP in Python and the joy of actually getting it working the next day, 
discovering the random library and feeling the power and confidence coding brought me 
that day.
